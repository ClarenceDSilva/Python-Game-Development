# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizzard-Spock

My first basic interactive game developed, is the famous "Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizzard-Spock" inspired by the popular sitcom [The Big Bang Theory](https://the-big-bang-theory.com/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/)<br/>
The user interactively plays with the computer through the program console<br/>
