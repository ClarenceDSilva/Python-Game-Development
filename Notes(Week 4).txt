Write a Python program that initializes a global variable to 5. The keydown event handler updates this global variable by doubling it, while the keyup event handler updates it by decrementing it by 3.

What is the value of the global variable after 12 separate key presses, i.e., pressing and releasing one key at a time, and repeating this 12 times in total?

To test your code, the global variable's value should be 35 after 4 key presses.

Q 2: Convert the following specification into code. Do the point and rectangle ever overlap?

A point starts at [10, 20]. It repeatedly changes position by [3, 0.7] — e.g., under button or timer control. Meanwhile, a rectangle stays in place. Its corners are at [50, 50] (upper left), [180, 50] (upper right), [180, 140] (lower right), and [50, 140] (lower left).

To check for overlap, i.e., collision, just run your code and check visually. You do not need to implement a point-rectangle collision test. However, we encourage you to think about how you would implement such a test
